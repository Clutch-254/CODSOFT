# Simple Calculator Program

## Overview
This is a basic command-line calculator application developed as part of the CODSOFT internship program. The calculator performs four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with built-in error handling.

## Features
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Support for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Input validation with error handling
- Protection against division by zero
- Clean results display

## How to Use
1. Run the program: `python calculator.py`
2. Enter the first number when prompted
3. Enter the second number when prompted
4. Select an operation by entering a number (1-4):
   - 1: Addition (+)
   - 2: Subtraction (-)
   - 3: Multiplication (*)
   - 4: Division (/)
5. View the calculation result

## Technical Implementation
The calculator is implemented in Python and includes:
- Error handling for non-numeric inputs
- Input validation for operation selection
- Special case handling for division by zero
- Formatted output display

## Acknowledgment
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to CODSOFT for providing this internship opportunity. This project has been an excellent learning experience, allowing me to practice Python programming concepts including input handling, error management, and basic arithmetic operations.

The guidance and structure provided by CODSOFT have been invaluable in developing my programming skills. I look forward to applying these learnings to future projects.
